Shift Change is an app that is to be used as a management tool for exchanging shifts between employees. It would be a link on the business site for the employee to use to surrender a shift, or pick up extra shifts. It is a work in progress. Right now you can create a sign in, create a post of a shift. and view shifts that need taken. We are working on the update and delete part of the CRUD. Also, the end goal is to have an admin(manager) that will oversee the exchanges for approval.
